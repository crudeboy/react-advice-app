# react-advice-app
This is part of a 30days master React challenge i created in February, 2022.
One React Project everyday or at most one in two days

This application uses the fetch advice API to display advice to the user by clicking a "Give Advice" button.

It is simplee yet cute.

Feel free to fork the repository and give it a star.
 See you around.
